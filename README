Collaborative Action Planning of Humanoid Robots Exchanging a Small Object

Before all:

Install Nao ROS package:
Follow instructions 3.2 v0.1 of http://wiki.ros.org/nao/Installation/remote.
Replace the script nao_camera.py.
Compile.

Add directories in .bashrc:
export AL_DIR=$HOME/Downloads/webots-for-nao/resources/projects/robots/nao/aldebaran/naoqi-runtime
export AL_DIR_SDK=$HOME/Downloads/webots-for-nao/resources/projects/robots/nao/aldebaran/simulator-sdk
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$AL_DIR/lib"



The planning of the exchange is done using behavior trees. Actions can be found in /src/actions.
The behavior trees can be found in /bt-examples. They use actions that were declared in the lauch files in /launch/, and which ROS nodes are declared in CMakeLists.txt.


In order to launch a ROS launch file, type in terminal:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Downloads/webots-for-nao/resources/projects/robots/nao/aldebaran/naoqi-runtime/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH roslaunch exchange "name of the launch file".launch

For instance:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Downloads/webots-for-nao/resources/projects/robots/nao/aldebaran/naoqi-runtime/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH roslaunch exchange NAO_humanBT.launch


To change the IP and ports of the NAOs, modify this information in the corresponding launch file you want to launch.
The object detection uses a HSV filter which coefficients S AND V are fixed (they can be modified in /src/imageconverter.cpp: search for "ballPosForHand" and replace the coefficients in getContourBall3).
Coefficient H can be set in /src/actions/TakeBall.cpp, search for "change here for the color".

The file or methods qualified as DEPRECATED should not be used, because they belong to older version which may not work anymore.
